Project: Automotive Terrain Response 2 (TR2) Digital Twin
Overview
This project involves the development of a Model-in-the-Loop (MiL) simulation for an automated Terrain Response system. I designed a Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) in Python that dynamically adjusts torque and system modes based on real-time physics feedback from a Modelica-based physical plant.
1. System Architecture
The project follows a co-simulation architecture where the "Brain" and the "Body" are decoupled:
* The Controller (Python): Contains the state machine, slip observers, and signal processing (Standard Deviation for jitter detection).
* The Plant (Modelica/FMU): A high-fidelity physical model of a 2200kg SUV, simulating rotational inertia, damping, and non-linear tire-surface friction.
* Interface: Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI 2.0) used for cross-platform execution.

2. Control Logic & Requirements
The controller was designed to meet three primary JLR-style engineering requirements:
* REQ-001 (Slip Detection): System must switch to Sand Mode when longitudinal slip ($\lambda$) exceeds 0.05.
* REQ-002 (Roughness Detection): System must switch to Rock Crawl when wheel speed variance (jitter) exceeds 0.2 rad/s.
* REQ-003 (Hysteresis): To prevent "mode hunting," terrain changes must be sustained for 3 consecutive cycles before arbitration.

3. Physical Modeling (Plant)
The vehicle dynamics are governed by the following differential equation, which I implemented in Modelica:
$$\text{J}_{wheel} \cdot \dot{\omega} = \tau_{motor} - F_{traction} \cdot r_w - b \cdot \omega$$
Where:
* $F_{traction}$ is modeled using a non-linear sigmoid friction curve to simulate traction limits on various surfaces ($\mu$).
* $b$ (damping) and $J$ (inertia) were tuned to stabilize the sensor signals for MIL testing.

4. Verification & Validation (The Results)
The final simulation run demonstrates the system's ability to navigate three distinct environments in a single 10-second window.
Final Test Case Result:
* 0-3s (Normal/Startup): System manages initial start-up oscillations.
* 3-6s (Sand): Friction dropped to $\mu=0.1$. The graph clearly shows Wheel Speed pulling away from Vehicle Speed. The controller successfully identified the slip and triggered Sand Mode.
* 6-10s (Rock Garden): Gaussian noise was injected into the wheel sensors. The controller’s signal processing identified the high variance and switched to Rock Mode.


5. Key Skills Demonstrated
* Systems Engineering: Managing the interaction between software and physical hardware.
* Digital Twin Development: Exporting and integrating FMUs into Python environments.
* Signal Processing: Implementing real-time standard deviation and slip observers.
* Calibration: Tuning PID-like damping and inertia parameters to achieve system stability.
